# leaflet-challenge
**Earthquake Analysis**: This project used leaflet, d3.js, and Mapbox to create a map from [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) API data on earthquakes in the last 7 days, along with GeoJSON data from a tectonic plates [repo](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates).

**Leaflet Step 1**: This folder contains the first part of the project, where the earthquakes are mapped as circle markers, sized by their magnitude, and colored by their depth.

**Leaflet Step 2**: This folder contains the bonus part of the project, where Step 1 was enhanced by adding multiple base layer options and overlay options (where the user can choose to see the tectonic plates & earthquakes mapped together or individually).
